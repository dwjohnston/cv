# cv

##

An HTML CV that converts to PDF. 

Uses [html5-to-pdf](https://github.com/peterdemartini/html5-to-pdf) a pretty handy node module. 

There are quite a few html to pdf converters out there, but I found a lot of them are either very expensive, or they don't support HTML5/flexbox.

## Usage

`npm install` 

then:

`npm run dev` - Start the dev server for development

`npm run publish-html` - Publish the index.html only

`npm run publish-pdf` - Publish the pdf 

Feel free to use this for your own purposes.
